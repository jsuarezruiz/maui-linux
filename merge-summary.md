# Merge Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the merge of upstream changes from `dotnet/maui` into the `devstroop/maui-linux` fork which adds Linux (GTK) support to .NET MAUI.

## Completed Actions

1. **Resolved Merge Conflicts**:
   - Resolved conflicts in build system files by adopting the GtkSharp naming convention
   - Preserved both upstream improvements and Linux/GTK-specific code
   - Adopted improved null handling and error handling from upstream

2. **Build System Consolidation**:
   - Merged build files with proper references to GtkSharp implementations
   - Updated .props and .targets files to maintain compatibility with both upstream and Linux support

3. **Code Improvements**:
   - Adopted code style improvements from upstream (null-conditional operators, etc.)
   - Preserved GTK-specific implementations while incorporating upstream bug fixes

## Next Steps

1. **Verify Build**:
   - Complete the full build process and verify there are no compilation errors
   - Ensure all components build correctly, particularly the GTK-specific implementations

2. **Test GTK Implementation**:
   - Run sample applications on Linux to verify the GTK implementation works correctly
   - Test core UI components and ensure they render properly

3. **Update Documentation**:
   - Update Status.md with latest implementation status
   - Document any changes in behavior between original fork and merged version

4. **Plan Next Merge Cycle**:
   - Establish a process for regular merges from upstream
   - Document merge strategy for future contributors

## Known Issues

- The build process is still running and needs to be verified
- Some UI components may require additional testing on Linux
- Performance impacts of the merge need to be evaluated

## Summary of Changes

The merge focused on preserving the Linux (GTK) implementation while adopting valuable improvements from upstream. The core strategy was to maintain minimal differences between the repositories in non-Linux specific code, while preserving all the GTK-specific additions.
